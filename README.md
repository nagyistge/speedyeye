SpeedyEye
=========

This is a simple high-speed tracking interface for the PS3 Eye camera,
usable from Processing or any other environment that can use memory-mapped files.

This is based on the [inspirit/PS3EYEDriver](https://github.com/inspirit/PS3EYEDriver) repository, which is in turn based on the Linux kernel source.
